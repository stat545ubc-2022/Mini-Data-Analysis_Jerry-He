# README.md: Mini Data Analysis 2
This directory contains files related to Mini Data Analysis Milestone 2.

## The Project
Milestone 2 of the Mini Data Analysis project is a continuation of Milestone 1, meant as a gentle introduction to simple data analysis in R. In this milestone, we explore the `cancer_sample` dataset from the `datateachr` R package. More specifically, we practice working with special data types such as factors, model fitting, and writing files robustly and reproducibly in R. These exercises are primarily aimed at addressing the question: **Can tumour compactness be used as a reliable diagnostic marker for tumour malignancy? If so, are there any other physical properties that share a positive correlation with tumour compactness and therefore malignancy?**

## Files
#### mini-project-2.Rmd
The R Markdown file of the Mini Data Analysis deliverable 2 containing some exploratory data analysis of the `cancer_sample` dataset from the `datateachr` R package. In this file, we work on manipulating factors, fitting models to data, and writing files in R. 

#### mini-project-2.md
The plain markdown file generated from knitting the .Rmd file. 

#### mini-project-2_files
A folder containing plots for mini-project-2.md. This folder is required for the .md file to render output plots. 

## Interacting With Directory Files
As stated in the main `README.md` file in the top level of this repo, we recommend using RStudio to clone this repository if you are interested in working with these files. Specific instructions on how to do this are outline in the top level `README.md`.
