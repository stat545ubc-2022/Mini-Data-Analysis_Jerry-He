## Running Code
The code in this repo can be run locally by cloning this Git repository. We recommend you use RStudio to run our code (since our code is all in R). To do this, open **RStudio** -> go to **New Project** in the upper right corners -> Click **Version Control** -> **Git** -> enter the **repository URL** and you are all set. The repository URL can be found under the **Code** tab in our repository.

The simple markdown files (.md) can be read in proper markdown format in GitHub. R markdown files (.Rmd) can be opened and run in RStudio. The .Rmd files in this repo contains code chunks (similar to a notebook) that can be run by clicking the “Run” button in RStudio.
If there are any functions in our code that you would like to see documentation for, you can enter the following command into the command line, substituting the function for your query:
```R
?function()
```
