# README.md: Mini Data Analysis 1
This directory contains files related to Mini Data Analysis Milestone 1

## The Project
Milestone 1 of the Mini Data Analysis project is meant as a gentle introduction to simple data analysis in R. In this milestone, we explore the `cancer_sample` dataset from the `datateachr` R package. More specifically, we perform basic summarizing function in R that are primarily aimed at answering the research question: **Can tumour compactness be used as a reliable diagnostic marker for tumour malignancy? If so, are there any other physical properties that share a positive correlation with tumour compactness and therefore malignancy?**

## Files
#### mini-project-1.Rmd
The R Markdown file of the Mini Data Analysis deliverable 1 containing some exploratory data analysis of the `cancer_sample` dataset from the `datateachr` R package.

#### mini-project-1.md
The plain markdown file generated from knitting the .Rmd file. 

#### mini-project-1_files
A folder containing plots for mini-project-1.md. This folder is required for the .md file to render output plots.
